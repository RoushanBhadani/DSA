//		--->because in StringBuffer all the method are Synchronized and we know synchronization increase the waiting time of thread and effect performance of the system.
		
		
//		that why StringBuilder come with non synchronized method so the performance is fast as compared to StringBuffer.
		
		
		
//		In StringBuilder all the method works same as StringBuffer but non synchronized.
		
		
//		Done.
